I'm a self-taught programmer, that currently working on my personal blog.

I'm working with Python, HTML, CSS, Java, Pascal and PHP, I think, it's all, what I need to feel yourself comfy! **\\(^v^)/**

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my website
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java
- ðŸŽ¶ I also play guitar and learn musical theory
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm a big music lover

When i was 4-5 years old, i've got my first computer. Since this time, i understand, that for me it's something more, than way to have fun. I spend almost all my childhood with making HTML and CSS websites, writing simple programs on Python, like Discord bot for my server, and trying to understand, how does computer works.

## I'm looking for a better future, and want found a job of my dream
